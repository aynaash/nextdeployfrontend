/**
 * The Opensearch ACL Rule resource models a single ACL Rule for an Aiven Opensearch service.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aiven from "@pulumi/aiven";
 *
 * const osUser = new aiven.ServiceUser("osUser", {
 *     project: _var.aiven_project_name,
 *     serviceName: aiven_opensearch.os_test.service_name,
 *     username: "documentation-user-1",
 * });
 * const osUser2 = new aiven.ServiceUser("osUser2", {
 *     project: _var.aiven_project_name,
 *     serviceName: aiven_opensearch.os_test.service_name,
 *     username: "documentation-user-2",
 * });
 * const osAclsConfig = new aiven.OpenSearchAclConfig("osAclsConfig", {
 *     project: _var.aiven_project_name,
 *     serviceName: aiven_opensearch.os_test.service_name,
 *     enabled: true,
 *     extendedAcl: false,
 * });
 * const aclRules = [
 *     {
 *         username: osUser.username,
 *         index: "index2",
 *         permission: "readwrite",
 *     },
 *     {
 *         username: osUser.username,
 *         index: "index3",
 *         permission: "read",
 *     },
 *     {
 *         username: osUser.username,
 *         index: "index5",
 *         permission: "deny",
 *     },
 *     {
 *         username: osUser2.username,
 *         index: "index3",
 *         permission: "write",
 *     },
 *     {
 *         username: osUser2.username,
 *         index: "index7",
 *         permission: "readwrite",
 *     },
 * ];
 * const osAclRule: aiven.OpenSearchAclRule[] = [];
 * for (const range of Object.entries(aclRules.map((v, k) => [k, v]).reduce((__obj, [, ]) => { ...__obj, [i]: v })).map(([k, v]) => ({key: k, value: v}))) {
 *     osAclRule.push(new aiven.OpenSearchAclRule(`osAclRule-${range.key}`, {
 *         project: osAclsConfig.project,
 *         serviceName: osAclsConfig.serviceName,
 *         username: range.value.username,
 *         index: range.value.index,
 *         permission: range.value.permission,
 *     }));
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aiven:index/openSearchAclRule:OpenSearchAclRule os_acl_rule project/service_name/username/index
 * ```
