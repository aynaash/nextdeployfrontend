title: Authentication  
description: Learn how authentication works in NextDeploy and how to secure your deployments.  
---

NextDeploy uses **SSH key-based authentication** to securely connect and deploy to your remote servers. No secrets in plain text, no username/password prompts — just secure, developer-friendly automation.

## 🔐 Why SSH Key Auth?

Password-based access is insecure and outdated. By default, NextDeploy uses **asymmetric encryption** to:

- Authenticate securely without exposing credentials  
- Allow agent-based and keyfile-based access  
- Prevent unauthorized deployments  
- Work seamlessly across Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or Git Bash)

## 🗝️ Generating SSH Keys

If you don’t already have SSH keys, you can generate them using:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
