NextDeploy is an **Open Source DevOps Platform** built for developers who want **full control** over their Next.js app deployments.

Designed to eliminate the limits of hosted platforms like Vercel, it gives you the power to deploy full-stack Next.js apps to any VPS — with a streamlined CLI, automated Docker builds, secure SSH-based deployments, and real-time container monitoring.

Built from the ground up in Go and Next.js, NextDeploy is:

- 🌍 **Cloud-agnostic** — use DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Linode, or your own server  
- 🛠️ **Stack-agnostic** — works with any backend you can containerize  
- ⚡ **Fast, lightweight, and production-ready** — no bloated pipeline or vendor lock-in

This documentation is your central hub to install, configure, and scale your deployments using NextDeploy.

Let’s dive in and take control of your Next.js infrastructure — the right way.
