# Why I Built NextDeploy

## The Problem

For years, I struggled with deploying Next.js applications. The process was always:

1. Configure Vercel/AWS manually
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines
3. Handle environment variables across stages
4. Monitor deployments across different services

The fragmentation drove me crazy. That's when I decided to build **NextDeploy**.

## The Solution

NextDeploy combines:

✅ **One-click deployments**  
✅ **Unified dashboard** for all environments  
✅ **Built-in monitoring**  
✅ **GitOps workflows**  

```ts
// Example: Deploy with NextDeploy
import { deploy } from 'nextdeploy';

deploy({
  project: 'my-app',
  env: 'production',
  autoScale: true
});
