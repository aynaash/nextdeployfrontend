> _“Shipping should be boring. Your DevOps stack shouldn't be.”_ — NextDeploy

Deploying a Next.js app used to mean choosing between Vercel, self-hosting, or complex CI/CD pipelines. **NextDeploy** gives you a third option: owning your deployment stack _without giving up automation or observability_.

In this post, we’ll walk you through deploying a production-ready Next.js app using **NextDeploy**, the CLI and daemon-based DevOps tool purpose-built for container-based Next.js deployments to any VPS.

## 🧠 What is NextDeploy?

NextDeploy is an open-source DevOps platform that lets you:
- 🔧 Build and Dockerize any Next.js app
- 🚀 Deploy to any Linux VPS with SSH access
- 📦 Attach databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL
- 📈 Monitor deployments in real-time via a dashboard
- 🔁 Handle logging, metrics, and failover out of the box

The core consists of:
- A **CLI** for init, build, deploy, and rollback commands
- A **Daemon** that runs on your server to manage containers, logs, system metrics, and recovery
